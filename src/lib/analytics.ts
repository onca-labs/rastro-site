/**
 * Analytics event helper for the GTM dataLayer (container loaded in
 * `src/app/layout.tsx` via NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID).
 *
 * GTM picks up the `dataLayer` array whether or not it has initialised yet,
 * so pushing before the container loads is safe — events queue and flush.
 *
 * Conversion/event tracking is keyed on these event names and on element
 * `id` attributes (GTM click triggers). Treat both as a tracking contract:
 * renaming or removing them can silently break a configured Key Event.
